**Brody** (short): a Proactive Multi-Agent AI Hub that *unifies schedules across apps and automatically prepares you for meetings* — prioritized summaries, decision points, supporting documents, and draft communications — before you ask.

**Vision:** Make knowledge workers 3–7 hours/week more effective by eliminating context-switching and making every meeting high-impact.

**Core features (MVP wedge):**

* Cross-app calendar/task aggregation (Gmail/Calendar/To-Do).

* Proactive Meeting Prep Engine: prioritized brief, key decisions, docs, suggested agenda, draft email.

* Lightweight orchestrator (LangGraph/agent flows) \+ high-quality LLM for summarization (student Gemini key allowed).

* Audit trail & “why this suggestion” justification.

**MVP aim:** Deliver a reproducible 1-click “Prepare my day” that turns calendar events into accurate 1-page briefs \+ one-click draft emails for each meeting.
