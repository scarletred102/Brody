# **Brody – Investor & Team Proposal**

### **Executive Summary**

Brody is the first **Proactive Multi-Agent AI Hub** that doesn’t just unify your tasks and meetings across apps—it **prepares you for them automatically**. While Copilot and ChatGPT react to prompts, Brody proactively fetches your schedule from Gmail, Calendar, and task tools, then:

* Prioritizes tasks for the day,  
* Generates briefs and documents for upcoming meetings,  
* Drafts and sends agendas or emails,  
* Build a schedule with you when none exists.

This makes Brody the **first productivity strategist**, not just another assistant—giving knowledge workers back 5–7 hours per week and reducing stress from context-switching.

### **Problem**

Modern productivity is broken:

* Workers lose \~9 weeks per year switching between siloed apps (HBR 2022).  
* Existing AI assistants (Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT) are **reactive**, waiting for commands.  
* Meeting prep consumes 15–20% of work time, but is mostly repetitive.  
* No current system provides **AI-to-AI collaboration** across tools to anticipate and act.

Result: inefficiency, decision delays, and wasted cognitive energy.

### **Our Solution**

Brody introduces a **multi-agent system** designed for proactive productivity:

1. **Proactive Base Agent** – learns your work rhythm, anticipates needs, and prepares your day.

2. **Task & Meeting Agents** – handle scheduling, file retrieval, summarization, and communication.

3. **AI-to-AI Coordination Layer** – sub-agents share tasks seamlessly, not just with the user.

4. **Cross-Tool Unification** – integrates tasks (Microsoft To Do), communication (Gmail), and files.

5. **Self-Evolving Knowledge Base** – personal context engine that gets smarter with use.

6. **Gamified Engagement** – keeps users motivated with points, feedback, and progress tracking.

### **Why Brody is Different**

* **Copilot** → Limited to Microsoft Office, reactive.

* **ChatGPT** → General purpose, no tool unification.

* **Gemini** → Broad AI, not productivity-focused.

* **Brody** → Proactive \+ unified \+ AI-to-AI orchestration \+ gamified.

### **Market Opportunity**

The digital productivity market will exceed **$50B by 2030**. First movers in the **proactive multi-agent space** can dominate B2B and enterprise adoption.

### **MVP Roadmap** 

**Goal:** Deliver the *“Prepare My Day”* experience.

**Core MVP Features:**

* Schedule aggregation across Gmail, Calendar, Microsoft To Do.

* Proactive daily summary with task prioritization.

* Meeting prep briefs: progress summary, key decisions, supporting documents.

* Draft agenda \+ draft email for each meeting.

* Simple neon UI (React frontend).

**Tech Stack:**

* **Orchestration:** LangGraph (multi-agent flows).

* **LLM Engine:** Gemini API (student developer credits for now).

* **Backend:** FastAPI \+ FastMCP for integrations.

* **Frontend:** React (web app, expandable to desktop later).

### **Scaling & Resource Needs**

* **Cloud Infrastructure** – AWS/GCP for APIs and inference.

* **Integrations** – API partnerships (Slack, Teams, Notion).

* **AI Development** – fine-tuned lightweight models \+ RAG for personalization.

* **Security** – compliance (SOC2/GDPR) to gain enterprise trust.

### **Challenges & Mitigation**

* **Tool Integration Complexity** → Start with Gmail, Calendar, To Do. Expand modularly.

* **Model Cost/Performance** → Begin with Gemini (credits) \+ Tiny models (Ollama) for fallback.

* **User Adoption** → Focus on intuitive UX and “1-click prep” wow moment.

### **Vision**

Brody will become the **control center of digital productivity**: the layer where all work data, tasks, and communication flow into a **proactive intelligence system**. Our long-term aim is to be the **trusted productivity OS** for knowledge workers and enterprises.
