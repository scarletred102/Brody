Perfect. ⚡ Time to switch gears from theory to execution — let’s lay out a **strategic buildathon game plan** for **Brody** that turns your idea into a working, judge-winning prototype *within 48 hours*.

We’ll structure this like a corporate strike plan — short cycles, clear deliverables, and tactical priorities.

---

## **🧭 Phase 0 — Mission Definition (Now → Friday Night)**

**Objective:** Lock scope, architecture, and responsibilities before you touch a single line of code.

| Task | Deliverable | Owner |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Define MVP Slice | “Brody Email–ToDo Agent Bridge” (core proactive use case) | Team Lead (you) |
| Architecture Draft | Flow: Gmail → AI Classification → Task Suggestion → ToDo Sync | Architect |
| UI Concept | Minimal dashboard (Inbox \+ Brody Suggestion \+ Accept/Ignore) | Frontend |
| Tech Stack Decision | FastAPI \+ React \+ OpenAI API \+ SQLite mock data | Full team |
| Mock Data Prep | Fake email data in JSON (subject, body, time) | Backend |

**Goal:** Know *exactly* what you’re building by Friday 10 PM.  
 No scope creep, no second-guessing.

## **⚙️ Phase 1 — Core Infrastructure (Saturday Morning, 8 AM – 12 PM)**

**Objective:** Set up the foundation — backend, agents, and communication.

### **🔧 Backend Setup**

* **FastAPI** base project with endpoints for:

  * `/classify_email` → uses OpenAI GPT API to categorize messages (urgent / casual / reminder).

  * `/suggest_task` → returns a proactive suggestion (e.g. “Schedule reply for 10 AM tomorrow”).

* **Local SQLite DB** or JSON file for temporary data storage.

### **🤖 Agent Logic (Minimal)**

* Simulate two agents:

  * **Email Agent** → scans new messages every 10s (polling mock data).

  * **ToDo Agent** → stores accepted tasks.

* Brody “Coordinator” function decides when to trigger suggestions.

### **✅ Deliverable by Noon:**

✅ Running backend that returns AI-generated task suggestions based on mock emails.

---

## **🖥️ Phase 2 — Frontend & UI (Saturday 1 PM – 7 PM)**

**Objective:** Create a slick, minimal UI that *wows judges* and communicates “proactive intelligence.”

### **💅 UI Components**

* **Email Panel:** Shows mock inbox messages.

* **Brody Suggestion Card:** “Brody noticed this message looks like a meeting request — add to ToDo?”

* **Task List:** Accepted items.

* **Points/Score Bar:** Gamification touch — 10 points for each completed suggestion.

Use:

* **React \+ TailwindCSS (Neon Theme)**

* Simple animations via **Framer Motion**

### **✅ Deliverable by Night:**

✅ Working frontend calling FastAPI endpoints \+ minimal gamified visuals.

---

## **⚡ Phase 3 — Proactivity Layer (Sunday Morning, 8 AM – 12 PM)**

**Objective:** Make Brody *feel alive*.

* Add an **auto-scan loop** (Brody reads new emails every 10s, triggers suggestions).

* Use OpenAI’s **function calling / agents API** to simulate reasoning chain:

  * “If email urgency \> threshold → create task.”

* Add a **“Brody Speaks”** element — animated dialogue bubble for feedback.

### **✅ Deliverable:**

✅ Brody autonomously reacts to data changes — demo-ready intelligence.

---

## **🎤 Phase 4 — Pitch & Polish (Sunday 1 PM – 4 PM)**

**Objective:** Prepare for judging like a startup launch.

### **🎬 Live Demo Flow**

1. Show inbox.

2. Trigger incoming email.

3. Brody pops up with a suggestion.

4. Accept → moves to ToDo \+ points increase.

5. Wrap with “Brody just saved you 2 minutes.”

### **🧩 Presentation Deck (3–5 slides)**

| Slide | Content |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1 | Problem: Time lost switching tools. |
| 2 | Solution: Brody — proactive multi-agent hub. |
| 3 | Demo & Architecture. |
| 4 | Impact: Saves 5–7 hrs/week. |
| 5 | Vision: Expand into full AI Hub post-buildathon. |

### **🧠 Key Pitch Line:**

“While other assistants wait for commands, Brody anticipates your needs. It’s the first multi-agent AI productivity hub designed to think *before* you do.”

## **🧩 Tech Stack Overview**

| Layer | Tools |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Frontend** | React \+ Tailwind \+ Framer Motion |
| **Backend** | FastAPI \+ Python |
| **AI Layer** | OpenAI GPT-4 API (for classification, task suggestions) |
| **Database** | SQLite or JSON Mock |
| **Integrations (Future)** | Gmail API, Microsoft To Do, Slack |
| **Version Control** | GitHub (commit every milestone) |

---

## **🥇 Winning Factors for Judges**

✅ Clear Problem → Solution → Impact narrative  
 ✅ Working demo (even partially)  
 ✅ Proactivity (not just another chatbot)  
 ✅ Original design & gamification  
 ✅ Understanding of tech stack \+ scalability
